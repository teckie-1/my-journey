<h1> My IT & Cybersecurity Learning Journey</h1>

I am a second-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in Linux, cybersecurity, and IT infrastructure. While I am studying computer science in college, a lot of my practical skills have come from hands-on projects, online challenges, and self-taught learning through YouTube tutorials and technical blogs.

I enjoy experimenting with system configurations, troubleshooting issues, and learning new tools by applying them in real-world scenarios. I'm still learning and improving, but I take on every challenge as an opportunity to grow my skill set.

💡 What I’ve Been Working On:

🔧 Linux System Administration

    Installed and configured Arch Linux on multiple machines, troubleshooting hardware and software issues.
    Set up and customized KDE & Hyprland, experimenting with system optimizations.
    Managed package installations, updates, and configurations using pacman and yay.
    Researched and applied basic networking and security configurations for system hardening.

🌐 Networking & Virtualization

    Worked with QEMU/KVM and VMware Workstation Pro to set up and manage virtual machines.
    Configured bridged and NAT networking for VM communication and security isolation.
    Learned to use Linux networking tools (ip, route, iptables) to manage network configurations.

🛠️ Scripting & Automation

    Created Bash scripts to automate network switching between bridged (isolated) and NAT (internet-accessible) environments.
    Still learning how to improve and optimize Bash scripts beyond basic functionality.

🔍 Cybersecurity & Hands-On Learning

    Working through TryHackMe, OverTheWire, and CTF challenges to gain security fundamentals.
    Learning basic Linux privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, and enumeration techniques.
    Exploring Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Metasploit, but still have a lot to learn.

📈 What I’m Still Learning

Since I’m learning both in college and through self-study, I’m always looking for ways to expand my knowledge. My current learning goals include:
✅ Improving my Bash scripting and automation skills.
✅ Gaining more hands-on experience with Wireshark, Metasploit, and other cybersecurity tools.
✅ Learning more about network security, firewall management, and Linux hardening.
✅ Participating in more CTF competitions to apply cybersecurity concepts in practical scenarios.

I know I still have a lot to learn, but I’m committed to growing my skills every day.
